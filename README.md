# Hi I'm Evan :wave:

Hey my name is Evan and I'm a student maker and tinkerer.  I am currently dual enrolled in an associates degree program at DVC along with being a high school student.  I've been programming ever since early 2019 when I started toying around with webdev and have since started toying with other things such as ml, ctfs, and low level programming.  Pre pandemic, I was also an avid hackathon organizer and attendee.
